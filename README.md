# Brad Fish's 1998 glFont package

This is a snapshot of the original, C language version of Brad Fish's glFont package.

In the late '90s a student at Brigham Young, Brad Fish, wrote some code to render fonts inside OpenGL.
This code became quite popular in the homebrew gaming scene and even in junior academics.
However, I was not able to find a copy online except through archive.org, and that's a hassle.
